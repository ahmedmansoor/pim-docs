# Authentication

The PIM API uses API key authentication. You need to include your API key in the Authorization header for all requests.

## API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: [api-key]
```

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you believe your API key has been compromised, contact the PIM system administrators immediately.
</Warning>

## Example Request

Here's an example of how to include the API key in your requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://pim.finance.gov.mv/api/v1/initiatives/projects" \
     -H "Authorization: your-api-key-here"
```

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive one of these error responses:

### Missing API Key

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "authentication_required",
    "message": "Authentication is required. Please provide an API key."
  }
}
```

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_api_key",
    "message": "The provided API key is invalid."
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Store Securely**: Store your API key in environment variables or secure configuration management systems.

2. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate your API keys periodically for enhanced security.

3. **Minimal Access**: Use API keys with the minimum required permissions for your use case.

4. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly monitor API key usage for any suspicious activity.

## Getting an API Key

To obtain an API key:

1. Contact the PIM system administrators
2. Provide your use case and required access level
3. Follow the provided instructions to securely receive your API key

<Note>
If you need to integrate the PIM API into your application, make sure to implement proper API key management and security measures.
