## Usage Notes

- This endpoint returns all locations without pagination
- Each location is identified as either an "atoll" or "island" type
- For atoll type locations, island_name and island_name_dv will be null
- Location codes follow a consistent format:
  - Atolls: X00 (e.g., "A00", "B00")
  - Islands: X## (e.g., "A01", "B02")
- All names are provided in both English and Dhivehi when available
