# PIM API Documentation

The PIM (Public Investment Management) API enables users to interact with the Public Investment Management system. Users can retrieve project details, monitor progress, and manage related data through RESTful endpoints.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://pim.finance.gov.mv/api/v1
```

## Authentication

PIM API requires an API key for authentication. Include the API key in the Authorization header for all requests:

```bash
Authorization: [api-key]
```

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of requests:

- `2xx` - Success
- `4xx` - Client error (invalid request)
- `5xx` - Server error
